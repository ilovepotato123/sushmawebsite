        <h3>Traditional Origins</h3>
        <p>
          Indonesian boat racing, or *Pacu Jalur* and *Perahu Naga*, dates back centuries as a celebration of local
          heritage, strength, and unity. It is especially popular in regions like West Sumatra and South Sulawesi.
        </p>

        <h3>Culture and Celebration</h3>
        <p>
          Boat races are more than competitions—they are cultural spectacles. Villagers gather in vibrant attire,
          accompanied by traditional music and food, to support their local champions and celebrate community pride.
        </p>

        <h3>The Boats and Teamwork</h3>
        <p>
          The racing boats are long and narrow, often hand-carved and colorfully decorated. Success relies on flawless
          teamwork, rhythm, and spirit as dozens of rowers move in perfect sync to cross the finish line.
        </p>

        <h3>Modern Revival</h3>
        <p>
          Today, Indonesian boat races are national events, drawing tourists and international attention. They symbolize
          endurance, cultural identity, and the power of unity through sport.
